# Mirror's Edge: Catalyst All-Platform Leaderboard

https://mecleaderboard.firebaseapp.com

By looking at www.mirrorsedge.com and its API calls, I was able to copy the calls and create a leaderboard with all three platforms. 

This uses Bootstrap v4 Alpha and AngularJS 1.4.8

Features:
- Consolidated leaderboard for all three platforms
- Click on a user to see platform-specific statistics

Limitations:
- Cannot search by user for stats as of now
- Purely client based webapp cannot hold persistent data

Future Goals:
- Set up a backend to link verified runs with video proof
- Make prettier
- Add more user stats

You can help by making API calls and seeing what else can be gathered from the servers. Just don't spam calls because DICE may close off the API from public use.
